Current Issue: 

26  February 2023: The code makes the prediction by using the ARIMA model, the issue is that i get some space between numbers of predicting the value and also get a dtype printed out? 

Also some warning messages which i must look in to. 

Either way the codes works, but i need to debug the code.

 Reminder: Just checked, i may need (Numpy) to clean the printed statement, ( Note to myself: Check Chatgpt, Stackoverflow or similar project)
